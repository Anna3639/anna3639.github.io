                <p>I am a Biochemistry major in my fourth year at the University of Massachusetts. I am also working towards a minor in Information Technology. I will be attending graduate school at the University of Toronto in the Faculty of Information. I hope to specialize in UX design. </p>

                <p>I’m interested in the problem of skewed user research and how that affects the design of our technologies. For instance, medical research disproportionately focuses on people of Western European descent. This could lead to inaccurate recommendations by AIs that scan for skin cancer, having been trained on data that lacks skin type and color diversity. Another application of thoughtful design could be in algorithms behind surveillance systems. Otherwise, they struggle to differentiate between race and actual factors that contribute to crime. In these instances, improving research, data collection, and implementation with regards to diversity would result in better healthcare and less unfair police scrutiny for more people. To this end, I hope to contribute to research that represents the actual population and to highlight the importance of inclusivity education for programmers and engineers. </p>
